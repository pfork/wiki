## initialization
## key-exchange
### optimal use
 - meet in a well-shielded place (e.g. underground-tunnel, just
   kidding a pub or park is good enough)
 - establishing a channel by issuing a pre-loaded PITCHFORK
### RF
1. The parties initiate a Key Exchange (KEX) over RF
2. The parties visually verify each others identities on the PITCHFORK display
3. PITCHFORK completes the KEX
4. The parties visually verify using the display that they all have the same secret.
### manual
## encryption
### Optimal use
1. on a trusted host encrypt the plaintext.
2. using a usbstick or sd card transfer the ciphertext to a host for transmission
3. transmit the ciphertext.
4. destroy the usbstick/sdcard.
## decryption
### Optimal use
1. receive ciphertext
2. jump airgap via cdrom, or printing the ciphertext using optar scanning it in.
3. on the trusted host decrypt the plaintext.
## signing
## verification
## key-management
## firmware upgrade
