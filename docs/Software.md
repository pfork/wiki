# PITCHFORK Software

This page attempts to document everything related to the software of the PITCHFORK.

In this project the term "software" pertains to everything running on
the other end of the USB connection. Currently this means a personal
computer, but in the future hopefully also on phones.

## Hardware Requirements

- a PITCHFORK
- a USB cable
- a host
