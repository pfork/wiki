The PITCHFORK comes in two form factors:
- a small USB token, and a
- nokia3310 board

currently both of them have a few bugs as in the latest version in
their gitrepos, the USB token version is fully functional with a
little bit of patching. The nokia version however needs a revised
board to make the buttons work.
